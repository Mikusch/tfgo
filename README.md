# Team Fortress: Global Offensive Arena
TF:GO Arena brings the bomb defusal mode from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive to Team Fortress 2.  
All players start with basic weaponry and can buy new gear at the start of each round with money earned from killing enemy players or planting the bomb.

## Compatible Maps
Any arena map that doesn't do wacky stuff should be compatible with this gamemode.  
A `func_respawnroom` entity for each team to define the buy zones is highly recommended but not required.
